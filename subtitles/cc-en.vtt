00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I am an underage student of the Aguefort Adventuring Academy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You see she says "Oh, the Aguefort..." And you hear a sound...
and a scarlet A appears in front of you.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And you see that an illusion hologram of Arthur Aguefort appears.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Hello and greetings. I am Arthur Aguefort.
And if you are watching this recorded message...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
One of my students has claimed diplomatic need of my help in foreign affairs.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Speaks in different languages rapidly]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In this instance, you should know that this student has been apprehended unlawfully...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And is under the protection of not only my academic independence,
but also the laws of the nation of Solace.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If they are harmed or injured in any way...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
RUIN will be brought down on your heads! NINEFOLD!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Arthur appears on a seaside cliff summoning storms]

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I shall bind you to the center of the earth!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I shall put you into the center of the sun!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I shall summon one thousand thousand dragons!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
To devour you for endless days!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And send your soul back to the dawning of time
to live as a mote of worthless scum!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Across vast eons!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The students of my school shall not be F***ED WITH!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Even now... DOOM moves upon you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you wish to avert this doom, press YES.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If you wish to welcome your doom, press NO.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Kiar looks at you... presses NO.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Very well. You have chosen the way of pain. Goodbye.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[The hologram disappears and alarms sound]

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
[A rift opens up revealing Arthur Aguefort's desk]

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Ah, Ms. Abernant.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Someone just selected the "Way of Pain" on one of these auto-notifications?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yes... I'm kidnapped in a tower and they have my sister locked in an orb.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Who... what institution has done this?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The High Elves of Fallinel.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Hmm. Very well. Let's do it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
[He crawls through the magic rift]

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Ah, indeed, we are in Fallinel.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Alright, well, if they were dumb enough to push that button...
We'll make them pay.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
[He leaps out of the tower window]

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
[He begins growing in size as he falls]

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Arthur turns down and says:
"Oh, turn your nose up at Fallinel?"

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
TODAY, YOUR NATION FALLS!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
[He reaches a hand up into the sky and grabs the sun]

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
[Fire races across the sky]

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
AGUEFORTS OF THE EARTH!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
TO WAR!!!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
[Thousands of terracotta Arthur Agueforts burst out of the ground]
